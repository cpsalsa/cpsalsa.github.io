    We are a student organization associated with California Polytechnic State
                    University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo dedicated to spreading our love of Salsa
                    dancing to San Luis Obispo and the rest of the Central Coast. While we are
                    associated with Cal Poly, our members and officers consist of non-students and
                    students alike.
