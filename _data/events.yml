    It's the fifth Tuesday of the month, which means we get an extra night of Madonna Inn! If you didn't know already, this is a FREE event brought to you by CPSalsa's training team, Sangre Nueva! Still, while it's FREE, we'd very much appreciate donations as they help support the team. (studio space, choreographer time, costumes for performing, etc)

    Dancing begins at 8:30 pm and goes until 11:00 pm (longer if people are feeling it). We will be playing your favorite salsa, cha cha cha, and bachata songs. If you're celebrating a birthday, let the DJ know you want a birthday dance. We'll see you there!
