    description: I'm a first-year Nutrition major, and am pretty new to the salsa scene, only starting dancing salsa and bachata in October of 2016. I joined CP Salsa because salsa dancing combines two very important aspects of my life. It allows me to connect to my Colombian half, and it lets me continue my love of dance. I'm pretty much always at our Friday Night socials, so if you see a short girl with a CP Salsa shirt, don't be afraid to say hi!
