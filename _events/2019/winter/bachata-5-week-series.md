# What's Bachata you say?
Bachata is a dance originating from the Dominican Republic danced to distinctive
music of the same name. It has the same 8 count pattern as salsa, but that's
where the similarity ends. If you want to know more about its origins, we've
got an [article](/archives/til-tuesday-bachata-origins) you can peruse.

### Get your Bachata up to snuff
So you want to learn Bachata and get up to speed quickly enough to make it look
good while on the dance floor? You're in luck because CPSalsa is hosting a
5-week progressive workshop series on Bachata. This series is ideal for
beginning and intermediate dancers.

Since it is progressive, each week builds on the last so that week's lesson so
that you can learn the dance in a more focused and faster paced environment.
Challenge yourself with this series! You won't regret the results.
