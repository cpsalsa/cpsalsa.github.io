# Sangre Nueva proudly presents...
This is a **free** event brought to you by CPSalsa's training team, Sangre Nueva!
Still, while it's **free**, we'd very much appreciate donations as they help support
the team. (studio space, choreographer time, costumes for performing, etc)

### The details
Dancing begins at 8:30 pm and goes until 11:00 pm (longer if people are
feeling it). We will be playing your favorite salsa, cha cha cha, and
bachata songs...maybe even a merengue. If you're celebrating a birthday,
let the DJ know you want a birthday dance. We'll see you there!

Interested in salsa and other lessons? Come to CPSalsa on Fridays for lessons
starting at 7:30pm.
