        <h1>Salsa Rueda de Casino</h1>
        <p>
            When you see a group of dancers dancing salsa together and
            exchanging partners like a square dance, you're seeing a form of
            salsa known as <em>Casino Rueda</em>. Typically, it consists of
            two or more partners, one of which is the <em>caller</em> who calls
            out the specific pattern, all of this danced in a circle (Rueda
            means wheel).
        </p>
        <h3>Want to learn it?</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to learn it, you're in luck! CPSalsa is hosting a 5-week
            progressive workshop series on Casino Rueda. This series is ideal
            for beginning and intermediate dancers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each week will introduce new concepts and moves designed to
            challenge and grow your dancing, and since it's progressive, will
            build on what was learned the previous week.

        <h3>IMPORTANT! Parking Permit</h3>
        <p>
            If you're driving onto campus, you need a temporary parking permit
