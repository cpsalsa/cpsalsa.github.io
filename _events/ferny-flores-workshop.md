# The Wonderful World of Ferny
CPSalsa kicks off 2019 with a workshop for our central coast
salseros y salseras! We are pleased to bring you the Enchilate
team choreographer from Fresno: Ferny Flores! You definitely don't
want to miss out on this.

### Friday Night Lessons
We kick things off Friday night where Ferny takes over our advanced
classes to teach you some footwork and partnerwork intended to
push your skills to their limits.

Then you'll have the rest of the night to dance with this fine
fellow (lead or follow) and practice the new tricks you learned in
class.

### Saturday Workshops
Saturday, we continue with a series of workshops focused on
technique.
