    Come and socialize with the CPSalsa members and officers!

    If you are interested in what it takes to become a member, socialize and
    see what we are about, and of course ask questions and even have a
    mini-lesson or ice-breakers while eating some snacks.
    
    After this we will be carpooling to our Madonna Inn socials.
