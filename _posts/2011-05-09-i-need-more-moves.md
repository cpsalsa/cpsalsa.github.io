For all the leads out there struggling with the &#8216;I need more moves&#8217; conundrum, I give you this sage bit of advice from Oliver Pineda:

<div class="youtube">
    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR_VC_myTkE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</div>


In a nutshell, what&#8217;s more important to the follows isn&#8217;t the number of combinations you know, but the way you lead the ones you know, how you interpret the music, and how you treat the follow while dancing. Not easy concepts, for sure, but important for all us leads in helping us be better social dancers.
