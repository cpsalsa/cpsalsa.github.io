> Si uno no baila en clave &#8211; metido en el ritmo de la musica, esta bailando contra la musica.

Cuban Pete was one of the celebrated dancers of the Palladium era of mambo/salsa in the 50s. I strongly encourage watching films ([here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wzkELAaXPI), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3HWUJI7Bag)) about this era of dancing to get an idea of the where salsa as a dance came from. The above quote translates to:Â _If you don&#8217;t dance on the clave- within the rhythm of the music, you are dancing against the music_. Comment below your thoughts on this quote and what it means to you.
