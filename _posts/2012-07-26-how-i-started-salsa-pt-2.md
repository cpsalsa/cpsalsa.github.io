In [Part 1](http://www.cpsalsa.com/archives/how-i-started-salsa-pt1 "How I Started Salsa PtÂ 1"), I told you about how I ended up at CPSalsa for the first time.

I&#8217;ve never been a natural dancer and I have zero natural rhythm. The night of my first lesson was a blur. A frustrating, confusing blur.

I felt like I was rubbing my belly, patting my head, and jumping on one foot at the same time.

Eventually the lesson ended and the lights turned off. The dancing started and I felt my frustration start to fade. Maybe this wasn&#8217;t so hard after all.

The other guys in my class were standing awkwardly in the corners of the room. I wondered what they were all waiting for. Ignorance makes bravery easy. I walked up to the nearest girl with a big, goofy grin, and said, &#8220;Would you like to dance?&#8221;

She didn&#8217;t hesitate. She just gave me her hand. I led her to the floor. We started dancing. I quickly discovered I had a problem. I only knew how to lead one turn. The instructor had taught more moves, but I hadn&#8217;t learned those. One turn. That&#8217;s all I had. And I&#8217;d already led it twice. So I led it a third time.

My partner glanced up at me.

Well? She seemed to ask, is that all you got? Yes, I shrugged. She looked away. The song ended and I slinked back to my corner. This was exactly as hard as I thought it would be. I thought about going home.

But of course, I didn&#8217;t go home. Something happened that made the night better, and I&#8217;ve been back every Friday for years.
