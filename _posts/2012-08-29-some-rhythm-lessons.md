### Want to Learn About Rhythm?

Found these drum lessons on youtube that give some great background and insight into two core rhythms in Afro-Cuban music. Pretty in depth since it&#8217;s meant to teach how to play these  on drums, but good nonetheless.

### Clave

First up, is the clave. As he says here, it&#8217;s the &#8220;rhythmic backbone to AfroCuban music.&#8221; As such, it&#8217;s perhaps the most important rhythm to know as a dancer of Salsa. When listening, you may recognize it when we clap it out during one of our songs on Friday nights. A thing to note when listening to songs: the clave isn&#8217;t always readily apparent. Sometimes, it&#8217;s implied in the other rhythms in the song.

### Cascara

Up next is the cascara. This rhythm is a complement to the clave. Like the clave, it&#8217;s not evident in every song, but you&#8217;ll definitely recognize it when you hear it.
