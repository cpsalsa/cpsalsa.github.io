    A while back I <a title="Some Rhythm Lessons" href="http://www.cpsalsa.com/archives/some-rhythm-lessons" target="_blank">posted a video</a> on the clave rhythm, but if you&#8217;ve been listening to a lot of salsa, you may find that you can&#8217;t actually hear it all the time. So how do you find the clave when you can&#8217;t hear it (you&#8217;ll likely want to do this when dancing on2 or in the clave)? This video explains how.

### When you can&#8217;t hear the clave&#8230;

A while back I <a title="Some Rhythm Lessons" href="http://www.cpsalsa.com/archives/some-rhythm-lessons" target="_blank">posted a video</a> on the clave rhythm, but if you&#8217;ve been listening to a lot of salsa, you may find that you can&#8217;t actually hear it all the time. So how do you find the clave when you can&#8217;t hear it (you&#8217;ll likely want to do this when dancing on2 or in the clave)? This video explains how. <!--more-->

You may need to turn up the volume quite a bit because the audio is quite low on the video.

### Using the bass

In short, the bass line will indicate the type of clave you&#8217;ll hear (2-3 or 3-2). If the bass hits predominantly on the 1, then it is a 3-2, if predominantly on the 8, it is a 2-3. Feel free to listen to some songs and practice finding the clave. Until next time!
